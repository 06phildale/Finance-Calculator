# Finance Calculator

## Objective

The Finance Calculator project was designed to create a Python-based application that allows users to perform financial calculations for both investments and home loan repayments. The primary focus was to implement user input handling, apply financial formulas for simple and compound interest, and calculate monthly bond repayments accurately. This project demonstrates practical programming skills and an understanding of basic financial mathematics.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in Python programming, including input handling and conditional logic.  
- Application of mathematical formulas for simple and compound interest calculations.  
- Implementation of financial calculations for real-world scenarios such as investment growth and bond repayments.  
- Developing user-friendly command-line interfaces for practical applications.  
- Attention to code readability, modularity, and error handling.

## Steps

*1: Program Startup*  
The program prompts the user to select either "Investment" or "Bond" and guides them through the required input parameters.  

*2: Investment Calculation*  
Calculates the total amount using either simple or compound interest based on user input. Screenshots can show sample calculations.  

*3: Bond Repayment Calculation*  
Calculates monthly repayment amounts using the bond formula. Screenshots can show repayment results for a sample property.

*4: User Interaction*  
Displays how the program handles invalid input and guides the user to correct entries.
